# Description of the assignment
We chose the song "Meet Me Halfway" by the Black-Eyed Peas because we felt as though it was a nice song to use, had a variety of beats with both slow and intense parts along with rap and a consistent beat. We also really liked the cover art for the 2009 album, "The End" which depicts a green skull. We thought it would be really interesting to implement and combine with the song along with other visuals. 

# Instructions
Press SPACEBAR to run the code.
Hit numbers from 1 to 6 to view the visuals!

# How it works
We used components of MyVisual such as the amplitude and frequency of the song to make our shapes or images react to the song. The visuals use this in real time as they are rendered when their respective key is pressed. All our visuals use various shapes that also visualise the lyrics of the song - whether it be a plants revolving around each other or heart split into half. This adds an even more immersive feel to our visuals.
