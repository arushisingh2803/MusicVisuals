# Description of the assignment
We chose the song "Meet Me Halfway" by the Black-Eyed Peas for our project. We felt as though there was a lot to work with within the song, whether it was the beat, the pace or the lyrics. We were also familiar with the song and upon our intial analysis of the song when we began this project, we agreed that the song rose and fell sufficiently to work with for our visuals.

Some parts that stood out to us were the lyrics, the constantly changing pace and intensity and the cover art for the 2009 album, "The End" which depicts a green skull. We thought it would be really interesting to implement and combine with the song along with other visuals. 

In this visual assignment, you will find visuals of a pulsing heart, a breaking heart, the cover art implemented as a visual, a spinning "The End" CD with surrounding synth strobe lights and a pair of eyes with moving, colour changing pupils that pulse to the beat, accompanied by "Game of Life" visuals.

# Instructions
Press SPACEBAR to run the code.
Hit numbers from 1 to 6 to view the visuals!

# How it works
We used components of MyVisual such as the amplitude and frequency of the song to make our shapes or images react to the song. The visuals use this in real time as they are rendered when their respective key is pressed. All our visuals use various shapes that also visualise the lyrics of the song - whether it be a plants revolving around each other or heart split into half. This adds an even more immersive feel to our visuals.


# Arushi Singh: What I am most proud of in the assignment
For me, I really enjoyed this assignment and branching out with other creative choices while also implementing ideas from this module too. 
I am incredibly proud of my heart visual as it was very much a trial and error process, with a lot of finicking around and adjusting. I had made my heart visual using trignometry and though it was hard and out of my depth at times, I really used features from sin, cos and tan to map out a heart shape. I'm also really glad that I managed to get it pulsating and beat like a heart to the beat and that I had the heart split directly down and came together without overlapping.

As for my second visual, I really wanted to implement something similar to having a face or using the art that the song is almost always associated with and so, managing to get the image and to recolour it to a grey so it could truly change colour was a challenge but in my opinion, a really smart move. I really liked how it came together overall.

If I had more time, I would've liked to have the eyes in the art to have been like strobe lights or lasers just to add a bit more to the visual. I would have also liked to have a camera feature that uses the laptop camera to register bodies and faces (using OpenCV library for example) and have that react to the music and combine the two visuals together. Overall, I am really proud of the how my visuals came together and enjoyed it thoroughly.

I found this assignment to be really interersting and a great opportunity for learning. I used some elements of my learning and taking it to a whole other level. 

For my visuals, I felt really proud of designing my planets visual. It took time trying to get all the different features and elements to work alongside each other but it came through. It was really intricate with beat spikes, stars and a Saturn-like planet along with having it display with different colours and I'm glad I put that work in and it shows.  The rings were proven to be some challenge but with a lot of attempts and rendering, I got there and it really did pay off, I feel super proud of how it came together.

As for my hearts visual, I was glad I could fill my screen entirely without it being overwhelming. I really liked the synth especially, I like that I got it to flow rather than spike, almost like an ocean wave. The heart beating was really nice and I felt as though it was really in theme with the other visuals. This visual took time to map out placements and was tediuous in this way but other than that there was no big issues.

If I had more time to put in, I would've liked to make my heart visual stand out a bit more by either having the eye behind my heart visual blink or I would transform the squares into cubes in the heart visual so that they could pulse and explode to the beat or with timing. Other than that, I am pleased with how it all came together and feel proud and happy with my visuals overrall.

Reflecting onn this assignment, I am really proud of how I applied the concepts I learned throughout this module. I think that this sentiment is really evident in my visual components.

One standout feature is the implementation of the Game of Life code. Although it presented a significant challenge during the labs, it resulted in one of the most memorable visuals I've ever created and it was something I was really proud of. I really enjoyed that it looked like confetti or fireworks and it struck a chord with me so I found it to be perfect to implement into this project, I was hoping to incorporate it in some way or another. Additionally, the eyes were also a part that brought me pride. The  sketching out a pair of circles and mapping visuals and creating borders to bounce back and forth was somewhat simple but it adds a whimsical charm and a bit of fun.  Sometimes, the most straightforward elements can put the most fun into a visual composition, and in this case, it added a playful twist that resonated with all of us.

I'm thrilled with the outcome of my synth waves. They turned out even better than I had imagined, and they complemented the spinning CD visual seamlessly. The CD idea was in my head for a long time and I found myself making it so much more complicated than it had to be. A simple image I made transparent sufficed perfectly and was all that was needed to make this visual sing. The synergy between these effects enchanced the overall both these effects really complimented each other, leaving me proud.

If given the time, i would've loved to implement and code up live lyrics that sync up to the song but it was proving to be much harder than I thought when I did attempt. Having lyrics pop up and circles explode to the beat would've had a great effect. Another idea I had was a Synesthesia water like effect that would move and rise and fall like water but also change colour. This would've taken up a lot of time however, I hope to create that visual someday soon as a side project.
